# 32. Dockerize App

today we are going to Dockerize a Next.JS application with Mongo database.
It is beginner docker tutorial that teaches you how to develop and deploy next.js application with Mongo database on docker.

1. Download docker desktop at https://www.docker.com/get-started/
2. Install docker and login to it
3. Dockerfile

   ```dockerfile
        # inherit from a existing image to add the functionality

        FROM node:20-alpine

        # Set the working directory
        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files into the image.
        COPY package*.json ./

        # Install the dependencies.
        RUN npm install

        # Copy the rest of the source files into the image.
        COPY . .

        # Expose the port that the application listens on.
        EXPOSE 3000

        # Run the application.
        CMD npm run dev
   ```

4. compose.yaml

   ```yaml
   # specify the version of docker-compose
   version: '3.8'

   # define the services to be run
   services:
     # define the web service for next.js app.
     web:
       # we use depends_on to specify that service depends on another service
       # in this case, we specify that the web depends on the mongo service
       # this means that the mongo service will be started before the web service
       depends_on:
         - mongo

       # specify the environment variables for the web service
       # these environment variables will be available inside the container
       environment:
         - MONGODB_URI=${MONGODB_URI}
         - AUTH_SECRET={AUTH_SECRET}
         - AUTH_URL={AUTH_URL}
         - PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=${PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID}
         - PAYPAL_APP_SECRET=${PAYPAL_APP_SECRET}

       # specify the build context for the web service
       # this is the directory where the Dockerfile for the web service is located
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile

       # specify the ports to expose for the web service
       # the first number is the port on the host machine
       # the second number is the port inside the container
       ports:
         - 3000:3000

       # this is for docker compose watch mode
       # anything mentioned under develop will be watched for changes by docker compose watch
       # and it will perform the action mentioned
       develop:
         # we specify the files to watch for changes
         watch:
           - path: ./package.json
             action: rebuild
           - path: ./next.config.js
             action: rebuild
           - path: ./package-lock.json
             action: rebuild
             # it'll watch for changes in the frontend directory and sync the changes with the container real time
           - path: .
             target: /app
             action: sync

     # define the db service
     mongo:
       # specify the image to use for the db service from docker hub.
       image: mongo
       # specify the ports to expose for the db service
       ports:
         - 27017:27017

       # specify the volumes to mount for the db service
       # we're mounting the volume named "amazona" inside the container at /data/db directory
       # this is done so that the data inside the mongodb container is persisted even if the container is stopped
       volumes:
         - amazona:/data/db

   # define the volumes to be used by the services
   volumes:
     amazona:
   ```

5. .dockerignore

   ```env
      Dockerfile
      .dockerignore
      node_modules
      npm-debug.log
      README.md
      .next
      .git
   ```

6. docker compose up
7. in a side by side terminal "docker compose watch"
